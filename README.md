### Assignment: Database Optimization for the Department of Civil Affairs in Germany

#### Overview
In this assignment, you will work with a simulated database for the Department of Civil Affairs in Germany. Your task is to optimize the database queries and structures using indexes, understand query plans using the `EXPLAIN` command, and demonstrate the use of combined queries and subqueries.

#### Setup
1. **Create the Database Schema**
   - You will create tables to simulate a simple system for managing civil records such as births, marriages, and deaths.

2. **Insert Sample Data**
   - Populate the tables with sample data to work with.

3. **Query Optimization**
   - Implement various types of indexes and analyze their impact on query performance.

4. **Query Analysis**
   - Use the `EXPLAIN` command to understand how queries are executed.

5. **Advanced Querying**
   - Use combined queries and subqueries to solve complex data retrieval tasks.

#### Step 1: Create the Database Schema
You will create three tables: `Persons`, `Births`, and `Marriages`.

```sql
CREATE TABLE Persons (
    PersonID SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    FirstName VARCHAR(100),
    LastName VARCHAR(100),
    DateOfBirth DATE
);

CREATE TABLE Births (
    BirthID SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    PersonID INT,
    BirthDate DATE,
    BirthPlace VARCHAR(255),
    FOREIGN KEY (PersonID) REFERENCES Persons(PersonID)
);

CREATE TABLE Marriages (
    MarriageID SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    PersonID1 INT,
    PersonID2 INT,
    MarriageDate DATE,
    MarriagePlace VARCHAR(255),
    FOREIGN KEY (PersonID1) REFERENCES Persons(PersonID),
    FOREIGN KEY (PersonID2) REFERENCES Persons(PersonID)
);
```

#### Step 2: Insert Sample Data
Insert sample data into the `Persons`, `Births`, and `Marriages` tables.

```sql
-- Insert Persons
INSERT INTO Persons (FirstName, LastName, DateOfBirth) VALUES ('Alice', 'M端ller', '1990-01-01');
INSERT INTO Persons (FirstName, LastName, DateOfBirth) VALUES ('Bob', 'Schmidt', '1992-05-15');
INSERT INTO Persons (FirstName, LastName, DateOfBirth) VALUES ('Carol', 'Becker', '1995-07-23');

-- Insert Births
INSERT INTO Births (PersonID, BirthDate, BirthPlace) VALUES (1, '1990-01-01', 'Berlin');
INSERT INTO Births (PersonID, BirthDate, BirthPlace) VALUES (2, '1992-05-15', 'Munich');
INSERT INTO Births (PersonID, BirthDate, BirthPlace) VALUES (3, '1995-07-23', 'Cologne');

-- Insert Marriages
INSERT INTO Marriages (PersonID1, PersonID2, MarriageDate, MarriagePlace) VALUES (1, 2, '2015-08-30', 'Hamburg');
```

#### Step 3: Query Optimization
Create different types of indexes and observe their effects.

```sql
-- Single-Column Index on LastName in Persons
CREATE INDEX idx_lastname ON Persons(LastName);

-- Multi-Column Index on BirthDate and BirthPlace in Births
CREATE INDEX idx_birthdate_place ON Births(BirthDate, BirthPlace);

-- Unique Index on MarriageID in Marriages
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_marriageid ON Marriages(MarriageID);
```

#### Step 4: Query Analysis
Use the `EXPLAIN` command to analyze the execution plan of a query.

```sql
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM Persons WHERE LastName = 'M端ller';
```

#### Step 5: Advanced Querying
Demonstrate the use of combined queries and subqueries.

```sql
-- Find all persons who are married and were born in Berlin
SELECT p.* FROM Persons p
JOIN Births b ON p.PersonID = b.PersonID
WHERE b.BirthPlace = 'Berlin' AND p.PersonID IN (
    SELECT PersonID1 FROM Marriages
    UNION
    SELECT PersonID2 FROM Marriages
);
```

### Task 6: Implement Partial Indexes
Create a partial index on the `Persons` table to optimize queries for persons born after the year 2000.

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_young_persons ON Persons(DateOfBirth)
WHERE DateOfBirth >= '2000-01-01';
```

### Task 7: Explore Implicit Indexes
Research and document how PostgreSQL handles implicit indexes, particularly with primary keys and unique constraints. Verify the existence of these indexes using the `\di` command in the psql terminal.

### Task 8: Analyze Index Scans
Use the `EXPLAIN` command to compare the performance of queries with and without the use of indexes. Document the differences in scan types (e.g., sequential scan vs. index scan).

### Task 9: Query Optimization with `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`
Run `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` on a complex query involving joins across the `Persons`, `Births`, and `Marriages` tables. Optimize the query based on the analysis.

```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT p.FirstName, p.LastName, b.BirthPlace, m.MarriagePlace
FROM Persons p
JOIN Births b ON p.PersonID = b.PersonID
JOIN Marriages m ON p.PersonID = m.PersonID1 OR p.PersonID = m.PersonID2;
```

### Task 10: Implement and Query a View
Create a view `VitalRecords` that combines data from `Persons`, `Births`, and `Marriages`. Write a query to retrieve all records from this view where the person's last name is 'M端ller'.

```sql
CREATE VIEW VitalRecords AS
SELECT p.FirstName, p.LastName, b.BirthDate, b.BirthPlace, m.MarriageDate, m.MarriagePlace
FROM Persons p
LEFT JOIN Births b ON p.PersonID = b.PersonID
LEFT JOIN Marriages m ON p.PersonID = m.PersonID1 OR p.PersonID = m.PersonID2;

SELECT * FROM VitalRecords WHERE LastName = 'M端ller';
```

### Task 11: Data Integrity Checks
Write SQL statements to add foreign key constraints to ensure data integrity between the `Births` and `Persons`, and `Marriages` and `Persons` tables.

### Task 12: Transaction Management
Demonstrate the use of transactions in PostgreSQL with proper commit and rollback based on conditional logic. For example, insert a new person and their birth record within a transaction.

```sql
BEGIN;
INSERT INTO Persons (FirstName, LastName, DateOfBirth) VALUES ('Daniel', 'Wolf', '1998-12-12');
INSERT INTO Births (PersonID, BirthDate, BirthPlace) VALUES (currval('persons_personid_seq'), '1998-12-12', 'Stuttgart');
COMMIT;
```

### Task 13: Locking Mechanisms
Explore and document different types of locks in PostgreSQL. Demonstrate how to apply row-level locking in a transaction.

### Task 14: Use of JSON Data Types
Modify the `Persons` table to include a column `Attributes` of type JSONB. Insert sample data and write a query to find persons based on a key-value pair in the JSONB column.

```sql
ALTER TABLE Persons ADD COLUMN Attributes JSONB;
UPDATE Persons SET Attributes = '{"eyeColor": "blue", "height": 175}' WHERE PersonID = 1;

SELECT * FROM Persons WHERE Attributes ->> 'eyeColor' = 'blue';
```

### Task 15: Performance Tuning with Caching
Discuss the role of caching in PostgreSQL. Implement a simulated caching strategy using a materialized view based on a complex query involving multiple joins and aggregation.

```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW CachedVitalStats AS
SELECT p.LastName, COUNT(b.BirthID) AS NumberOfBirths
FROM Persons p
JOIN Births b ON p.PersonID = b.PersonID
GROUP BY p.LastName;
```
